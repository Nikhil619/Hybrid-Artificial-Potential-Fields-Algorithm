# Hybrid-Artificial-Potential-Fields-Algorithm
# The code outputs V_x, V_y and time duration which should be passed to the pixhawk controller
# We have used an optical flow sensor with sonar (px4flow) in the place of gps for position estimation

# THIS CODE CAN BE USED FOR COMPLETE 360 degree OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE!!! WITHOUT GPS
# Please check the dronekit documentation to set the optical flow sensor up with the flight controller
